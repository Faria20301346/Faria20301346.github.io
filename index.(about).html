Reading has always been a huge part of my life; it's not just something I do for fun, it's something that truly lights me up inside.
Among all the authors I've explored, there's one that really speaks to me: Chetan Bhagat. His writing, especially in 'Revolution 2020,
But it's not just books that capture my heart; art does too. Drawing has been my go-to since I was a kid. It's like my way of expressing
myself, of capturing all the beauty I see in the world around me. And color? Oh, color has always been my thing. Ever since I was little,
I've been fascinated by all the vibrant shades nature has to offer. Give me some colored pencils or paintbrushes, and I'm in my element.
One of my absolute favorite things to do is turn my artistic ideas into something real. Whether it's painting, sketching, or crafting, 
I just love bringing my imagination to life. There's this magic in taking ordinary objects and turning them into something extraordinary,
all with just a splash of color and a dash of creativity. And you know what's even better? Sharing my passion with others. That's why 
I started a Facebook page dedicated to showing off my creations. It's like this little corner of the internet where I can put my artwork 
out there, share my thoughts on the creative process, and connect with people who love art as much as I do. The community that's grown 
around my page is incredible; they're always inspiring me to try new things and push myself further in my creative journey.
At the end of the day, my love for reading, drawing, and crafting isn't just about me having fun; it's about embracing the beauty of 
storytelling and self-expression, and finding joy in sharing that beauty with the world around me.
